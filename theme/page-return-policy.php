   <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        We accept exchanges or store credit on eligible items returned within 14 days of delivery. To qualify, items must be unworn, unwashed, and returned in their original condition with all tags attached. Please note that customers are responsible for any return shipping costs. Customized orders, including those with sizing adjustments, are final sale and not eligible for exchange or store credit.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        To help ensure the best possible fit, we’re happy to customize the standard sizing of your piece by adjusting up to 2–3 inches at the bust, waist, or hips. If you’d like these complimentary adjustments, please include your bust, waist, and hip measurements in the optional notes section at checkout, or reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@cotidienlabel.com" class="underline hover:text-black">info@cotidienlabel.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm mb-4 italic">
        We’re here to help you feel confident in your order — please don’t hesitate to get in touch with any questions about sizing or fit before placing your order. This policy may be revised in the future as we continue to grow.
